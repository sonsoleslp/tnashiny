Transition Network Analysis (TNA) is a methodological framework for building and 
 plotting transition networks, calculating centrality measures,
and identifying dominant events and patterns. TNA statistical techniques
(e.g., bootstrapping and permutation tests) ensure the reliability of
observed insights and confirm that identified dynamics are meaningful.
See [(Saqr et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3706468.3706513) for
more details on TNA.

TNA can be used troughout the R package of the same name [`tna`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tna) or through the Shiny app available in this repository. A demo is also available online: [https://sonsoleslp.shinyapps.io/tna-app](https://sonsoleslp.shinyapps.io/tna-app/).
